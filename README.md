# Best Countries for Digital Nomads Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes various factors to determine the best countries for remote work. The analysis focuses on factors such as Weather, Cost of Living (rent price, groceries, utilities), Work Permits (Information on work visa policies, including the types of visas, income requirements).

The project uses Python and SQL queries to combine these factors and generate insights about the best cities and countries for remote workers. The analysis data are used to filter and sort the information based on user preferences, such as affordable living costs or ideal weather conditions.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, it is necessary to have Python, SQLWorkbench, Tableau.

## Datasets

The data for this project was primarily sourced from publicly available datasets on Kaggle, which provided comprehensive information on cost of living, rent prices, and weather data for various countries and cities.

In addition, web scraping techniques were employed to gather data on work permit policies (such as visa types and requirements), as this specific information was not readily available in structured datasets. To complete the dataset, manual collection was also used to fill in any missing or incomplete data points, ensuring a more comprehensive and accurate analysis.
